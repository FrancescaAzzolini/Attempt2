"Boh.R" is a code to analyze some data about sanderson's books. The Data are summarized in "Sanderson.txt".

"Boh.R" is a test.

Note: because of a mistake, "Boh.R" is now called "Attempt3.R". I will fix the problem soon enough.

In this branch (test1), I rewrote the code as it went missing for reasons unknown.
